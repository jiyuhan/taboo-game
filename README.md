## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Game Duration
In `app/page.tsx`, change the initial `timeRemaining`:
```typescript
timeRemaining: 300, // 300 seconds = 5 minutes
```

### Modify Categories
Edit the `categories` array in `components/CategorySelection.tsx`:
```typescript
const categories = [
  {
    name: 'Your Category',
    emoji: '🎨',
    description: 'Your description',
    color: 'from-color-to-color',
  },
  // ... more categories
];
```

### Change AI Model
In `app/api/get-clue/route.ts`, modify the model:
```typescript
model: 'gpt-4o-mini', // or 'gpt-4o' for more creative clues
temperature: 0.9, // Higher = more creative (0.0-2.0)
```

### Adjust Scoring
In `components/GamePlay.tsx`, change the points:
```typescript
score: prev.score + 10, // Change to any value
```

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

The game is fully responsive and works great on:
- 📱 Mobile phones (portrait & landscape)
- 📱 Tablets
- 💻 Laptops & desktops
- 🖥️ Large screens

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### API Errors
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct in `.env.local`
- Check that you have API credits available
- Ensure the `.env.local` file is in the root directory

### Build Errors
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Delete `.next` folder and rebuild: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`

### Styling Issues
- Clear browser cache
- Make sure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

## 🚀 Deployment
